# Verification of Quantum Systems using Barrier Certificates

Prototype implementation of barrier certificates for quantum systems.

## Running the Code

The examples are tested on a virtual machine using Python 3.9.5.

1. Install the requirements file (if in the provided VM you only need to run (b) to activate the environment)

    a. ```python -m venv env```

    b. ```source env/bin/activate```

    c. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
    
2. Run the examples:

    ```python ex_<name>.py``` 

3. Generating the figures:
    
    ```python media/diagrams.py```

    Figures are available in ```media/Images/```.
